 *
 * A route selector is responsible for selecting the best route in a routing table. It works similar to a cache: to
 * update the routing table the update() method of the selector should be used. This allows the selector to adjust
 * the selected route/neighbor in the most efficient way possible.
 *
 * DO NOT update the routing table outside of the selector. Doing so will prevent the selector from working correctly
 * since it is not informed of the changes performed to the table.
 *
 * The constructor takes the routing table holding the routes, a forceSelect flag, and a compare method. If the force
 * reselect flag is set to true it will force the selector to reselect the route/neighbor based on the initial routes of
 * the given table. By default, the flag is set to true. This flag should be set to false if and only if you are
 * sure the table contains only invalid routes. The compare method should take to routes and compare their
 * preferences. It should as a common compare method which returns a positive value if the left route has higher
 * preference than the right route, 0 if they have the same preference and a negative value if the left route has a
 * lower preference than the right route.
 *
 * @param table         the table to select routes from
 * @param forceReselect if set to true the selector will perform a reselect operation in the initializer
 * @param compare       the method used by the selector to compare the routes
