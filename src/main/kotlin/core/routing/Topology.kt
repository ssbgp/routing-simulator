 *
 * Topology is an high-level abstraction of a network composed of nodes and their interconnections.
 * This interface defines the interface that is common to all topologies.
 *
 * Notice the Topology interface does not define any methods to add/remove nodes or links. Topology implementations
 * should be immutable! That is, there should be no way to add or remove nodes from the topology and the same should
 * be true for links. A topology should be built using a topology builder @see TopologyBuilder.
 *
 * Each node in a topology is uniquely identified by its ID. Therefore, the topology interface provides methods to
 * access topology nodes using their IDs.
 *
 * This interface takes a generic type N that extends from Node. N is the type of nodes that the topology holds.
 *
 * @property size the number of nodes in the topology
