 *
 * Routes are pieces of routing information that associate a set of attributes with a destination. Usually, nodes
 * exchange routes with their neighbors in other to provide connectivity to one another.
 *
 * Routes may be invalid. An invalid route indicates that there is no electable route to the destination via some
 * neighbor, which means that an invalid route should NEVER be elected by a node. Routes can be checked for validity
 * through the isInvalid() method included in the Route interface.
 *
 * Implementations of the Route interface should be always immutable!
